When a vulnerability is found, it needs to get into the right hands quickly to ensure it'll be resolved safely without public harm. Organizations typically publish a vulnerability disclosure policy with guidance on how they want to receive information related to potential vulnerabilities in their products or online services (see ISO 29147). Some organizations, however, don't have well-defined methods of receiving vulnerability reports from external finders. 

In the absence of a vulnerability disclosure policy, attempts to report security vulnerabilities often carry considerable legal risk for the hacker, causing many to simply withhold vulnerability information or publish anonymously. In these cases, it's impossible to achieve an optimal outcome that ensures security vulnerabilities are safely resolved, and it causes the internet to be less safe than it could be.

It's HackerOne's best interest to help friendly hackers be able to disclose vulnerabilities to any organization.

### What is Disclosure Assistance?
When an organization doesn't have a vulnerability disclosure policy, with Disclosure Assistance, HackerOne will work with friendly hackers on a best effort basis to:
* verify the legitimacy of a vulnerability.
* reach out to and verify the identity of an individual at the affected organization.
* share the vulnerability with the organization so it can be resolved.

HackerOne will take steps to offer assistance in identifying the organization's official vulnerability disclosure policy.

To aid in this process, HackerOne introduces the Directory to assist in disclosing vulnerabilities. The Directory identifies the best way to report potential vulnerabilities directly to the organizations that can resolve them. If the directory doesn't provide enough information to contact the organization with a vulnerability, they can request Disclosure Assistance.
