### Custom Fields (beta)
We introduce [custom fields](/programs/custom-fields.html) to enable programs to add custom information to their reports to help them better manage and analyze their internal data by the categories that they define to be important. This feature is only available for Enterprise programs.

We've also added a new API endpoint for filtering reports through custom fields.
