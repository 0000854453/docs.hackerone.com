### My Programs
We’ve renamed the Accepted Invitations page on the Hacker Dashboard to now be called My Programs. We’ve also revamped the page so that hackers can better manage the all of the programs they’re a part of by including:
* More filtering options
* Sorting
* A search bar
* A *My stats* section for each program where hackers can see their personal statistics for the program
