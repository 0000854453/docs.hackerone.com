### Program Page Bookmark and Subscribe Buttons
We've deprecated the **Follow** button on the Program Page and replaced it with a **Bookmark** button. We also moved the **Subscribe** button from the bottom of the Program Page and moved it to the top next to the new **Bookmark** button so that hackers can easily subscribe to program updates and add programs to their bookmarked program list on their dashboard.
