### New Settings on Notification Preferences
We've revamped the Notification Preferences page and added new settings so that all users can better customize their report notifications to reduce noise from unwanted notifications.

### Program Page Bookmark and Subscribe Buttons
We've deprecated the **Follow** button on the Program Page and replaced it with a **Bookmark** button. We also moved the **Subscribe** button from the bottom of the Program Page and moved it to the top next to the new **Bookmark** button so that hackers can easily subscribe to program updates and add programs to their bookmarked program list on their dashboard.
