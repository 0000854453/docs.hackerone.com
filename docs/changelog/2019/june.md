### Mark a report as ineligible for bounty when awarding swag
We introduce the new **Also mark as ineligible for bounty** checkbox so that programs can now mark a report as being ineligible for bounty when awarding swag.

Programs are also able to now award swag to reports that are marked as ineligible for bounty.
