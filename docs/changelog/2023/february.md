### Hacker Mediation Updates
HackerOne does not accept Hacker Mediation Requests for reports submitted to Basic programs not managed by HackerOne.

### Opportunity Discovery Cards
Opportunity Discovery cards have been updated to improve clarity and readability.

### Retesting
If the original hacker rejects the retest, the report will pass back to the customer in its previous state. Customers are also able to cancel a retest if the original hacker does not respond in time. 
*Note: Retesting is not available for anonymous reports.*

### Slack Auto-Integrations
Programs will now automatically have three Slack channels created when their pentest opens to applications. This is where you can find all appropriate communication channels.

### Scope Management
Programs now have a new **Scope** tab on the Security page. From here, both hackers and programs can see the assets' CVSS score, whether they are in or out of scope, and whether or not they are eligible for bounty.
