The 72hr timer from retests has been removed, so there will be no time limit to accept or confirm retests.

### Report Translations
Hacker reports and responses can be translated into Dutch, German, Hindi, and Spanish. You an do this by clicking on any part of the report and selecting a language in the kabob menu (3 vertical dots). You have to select each response to translate it, and this works on both Inbox and public Hactivity content.
