### CVE & CWE Discovery
CVE & CWE Discovery helps you discover trends in common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) and common weakness enumerations (CWEs). By better understanding the vulnerability landscape, hackers can focus their research efforts on existing threats that are still being exploited, while organizations can gain insight into existing threats and harden against new ones.
