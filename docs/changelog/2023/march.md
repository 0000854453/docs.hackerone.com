### Pentest Cloning and Naming
Customers can now choose to clone an existing pentest when making a new one, and pentests can now have custom names. When creating a new pentest, customers can select the option to clone an existing pentest instead. This will prepopulate the form with details from the original pentest such as scope, asset details, and contact preferences.
