### Pentest Ratings
We now enable pentesters to provide feedback about their pentest experience. Both pentesters and pentest programs can also provide feedback on the pentesters they worked with. This will enable pentesters and pentest programs to see what they've done well and/or how they can better improve.

### My Feedback
We've added a new **My Feedback** section to the hacker settings where pentesters can see all of the feedback they've received from pentesters and pentest programs they've worked with. They can also elect to make their feedback public on their profile.
