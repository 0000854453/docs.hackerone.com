### Updates to CVE IDs
We've made these improvements to CVE IDs to help users get their CVE IDs faster and to simplify the publication process:
* **Immediate CVE ID assignments:** Users will no longer have to wait in getting their CVE IDs as HackerOne will now immediately and automatically assign a CVE ID to a request created through HackerOne.
* **"Auto-Submission":** We now offer the new *Auto-submission* option in the CVE request process that'll enable CVE requests to be submitted automatically for approval and publication when the attached HackerOne report is publicly disclosed. 
* **Publication Reminder Emails:** HackerOne will now send users weekly reminder emails of their CVE IDs that have yet to publish an advisory.
