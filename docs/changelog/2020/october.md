### Microsoft Teams Integration
We introduce the [Microsoft Teams integration](/programs/microsoft-teams.html) to all Enterprise programs. This enables Microsoft Teams users to keep up-to-date with what's happening in their program as they can now receive notifications of HackerOne report activities directly in their selected channels.

### Bi-directional ServiceNow Integration
We now offer a bi-directional [ServiceNow integration](/programs/servicenow-integration.html) to all Enterprise programs. This will create a better workflow of remediating security vulnerabilities as ServiceNow users can synchronize their HackerOne reports to ServiceNow incidents and vice versa, from ServiceNow to HackerOne.
