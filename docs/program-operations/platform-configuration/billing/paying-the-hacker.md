HackerOne makes it easy to pay hackers. You can choose from these 2 options to to pay a hacker:
1. Add a credit card to your HackerOne account that we charge to pay out bounties.
2. Make an advanced deposit which bounties can be paid out from. Whenever your team decides on a bounty, you simply set the amount you'd like to pay on the report, and it's withdrawn from your balance. When funds are running low, HackerOne will request another advanced deposit. HackerOne recommends depositing 3 months' worth of bounty budget at a time.

The typical time to remit payment to hackers is 2-7 days. 

With HackerOne taking care of your payments, you don't have to worry about:
* Compliance
* Taxation
* Finding yourself in situations such as figuring out how to pay a hacker in an obscure place that doesn't have a mailing address

HackerOne also collects the appropriate tax forms to remove the operational headache for you.
