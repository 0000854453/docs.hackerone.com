#### Adding Users
>Hint: Add groups before adding users to avoid adding people without any groups. Pending users can not be added to groups.

1. Go the Organization Settings > Users
1. Click on **Add new user**
![Users page](/images/users-1.png)

1. Provide the email address of the user that should be invited.
	1. Users who were already added cannot be added again.
1. Select if this user should be an organization administrator.
    1. Adding a user as an organization administrator will allow them to add, manage, and remove other users, groups, and assets from the organization.
	1. Every organization must have at least one admin.
1. Select the groups the user should be added to. Groups determine what users can access and do in your program.
    1. By not adding a user to a group, they will be able to onboard onto the platform, but unable to access or take any action on the platform.
    1. **Tip:** If you would like to add a user to a group that doesn’t exist yet, we recommend that you create the group first and then add the user.
1. Click on **Add new user** at the bottom of the page to finish.
1. This will trigger a single invitation to join the organization. Once the User accepts the invitation, they will have access based on the groups they were invited to. 

Once a user is added they will appear under **Pending users.** Users in this category can only be edited once they have been onboarded into the organization. 

>Note: Before a user is added we check the eligibility for the user to be invited based on which domains have been set up. This can be found and managed in **Authentication.**

### Editing & Removing Users
Edit users by clicking on the kabob menu next to their information and clicking **Edit User.**

You can also edit users by going to their overview page and clicking **Edit User.** The user’s profile will be shown, including user details, organization permissions, and program & asset permissions.

Selecting **Remove User** in either menu will remove the user from all groups.
