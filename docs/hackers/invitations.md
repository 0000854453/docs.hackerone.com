In order to hack on private programs, you must receive invitations to them. You can receive invitations if you meet the following criteria:
* Established reputation
* Positive signal
* Clear record with zero code of conduct violations

HackerOne manages invitations for programs by:
* Daily checking to see if the program has met their report volume target in the last 30 days
* Inviting hackers for the program if they're not reaching their report volume target

### How Invitations Work
The number of invitations HackerOne sends is based on the program's report volume on a rolling 30 day basis. These are the use cases as to how HackerOne sends invitations:

Case | Action
---- | ------
The program is far from meeting their report volume. | HackerOne will gradually increase the number of invitations so the program can meet their report volume.
The program is receiving more reports while still being under their report volume. | HackerOne will send out fewer invitations.
The program's report volume is met. | Invitations will pause until the volume drops below the target in the 30 day window.
The program's report volume is set to 0. | No invitations will be sent.

Sometimes programs will manually invite you to hack on their programs. Keep in mind that it's a violation of Disclosure Guidelines for you to reach out to a private program in request for an invitation.
