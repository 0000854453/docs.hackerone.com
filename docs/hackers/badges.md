### What are the hacker badges and how to get them

Launched since 2016, badges are important events or achievements the hackers will get when they reached certain conditions. All HackerOners have their own badges and these are publicly accessible on the profile page, for example, hackerone.com/[hacker-name]/badges

Badges are made up in figures of various bug types; each consists of badge name, short description and achieved date. Some badges have many levels depending on certain numbers which are starred at the right of the figures.

The following lists the current badges with the description of how to get them. You will likely get most of the badges when reaching a certain level on your bug bounty journey, and there are some badges which are event-based and requiring more skills to achieve.
