### Donating your Bounty to Charity
You're able to donate your bounty to charity! If you want to donate a bounty:
1. Sign into your HackerOne account and [submit a support ticket](https://support.hackerone.com/hc/en-us/requests/new). 
2. Mention the following in your request: 
   * The ID of the report you want to donate the bounty of. You can get the report ID from the URL (e.g. https://hackerone.com/reports/123, where 123 is the ID).
   * The name and website of the charity you want to donate to.
   * Whether or not you want to be named as the person donating or prefer to remain anonymous. Note that we can only attribute the donation to you if the charity allows us to put a name in.
   
Upon receiving your request, HackerOne will do a quick check to see if a donation can be made to your selected charity. If for some reason a donation can't be made, HackerOne will notify you so an alternative can be made. 

Generally, if the charity acceptions donations in USD through PayPal or Credit Card, HackerOne should be able to fulfill your request quickly. If the charity provides an electronic receipt, HackerOne will forward this to you as proof of payment. 

At this time, we can only donate bounties in full as we can't do partial or split donations.
