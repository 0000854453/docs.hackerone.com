Congratulations on deciding to use HackerOne as your platform in submitting vulnerabilities! Here are the steps that'll get you up and hacking: 

1. Create an account [here](https://hackerone.com/users/sign_up). <br>You don't have to use your real first and last name in creating an account. We understand that some hackers want to remain anonymouns and not disclose their real identity. You're free to use a pseudonym of your choice to keep your identity from being dislosed. 
2. Verify your email by clicking **Confirm email address** in the verification email sent to your personal email.  
3. Configure your profile and account settings under **Settings**. You can customize these settings:

Option | Detail
------ | -------
Profile | Add a picture to your profile, change your username, add a website, your location, and a personal blurb about yourself. 
Authentication | Set up two-factor authentication.
