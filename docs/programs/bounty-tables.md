A bounty table shows how much your program is willing to pay for various bugs you receive. They help set expectations for hackers and gives your bug bounty team a guideline to ensure fair and consistent reward amounts. The bounties in the table are categorized based on the severity of the issue identified. 

To set up and publish your bounty table on your security page:

1. Go to your programâ€™s Settings > Rewards > Bounties. 
2. Input your bounty amounts for each severity rating under the Bounty Table section. 
     * Note: Critical vulnerabilities should have the highest bounty amount whereas a severity rating of Low should have the lowest amount. 
3. Click <b>Save this bounty table!</b>
