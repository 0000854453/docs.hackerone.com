### Awarding a Bounty for Reports Received Outside of HackerOne
The HackerOne API can be leveraged to award hackers for their efforts that submitted vulnerabilities to your organization outside of HackerOne. To start paying hackers, generate an API token on your Program settings page. This option is only available in HackerOne Professional, HackerOne Enterprise, and HackerOne Community Edition. This API endpoint is not for awarding bounties for reports on HackerOne itself, only for reports that were reported outside of HackerOne.
