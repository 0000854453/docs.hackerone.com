### Transparency Trust

Bug bounty programs benefit from transparency by building trust between you and your hackers. Having a clear policy page, friendly language, clear engagement rules, and benefits (like visible bounty table) are some of the simple methods you can use to break down walls and start building a trusting relationship.


### Engagement

A clear bounty structure is something hackers call out when looking for programs to participate in. They want to know what they'll be rewarded fairly if they spend their time and effort helping a program. Programs with clear rewards structures tend to generate more positive engagement.


### Your Teams Workload Management

Having a defined amount per severity award means your teams can make faster decisions instead of worry about how to calculate fair awards. It also precludes hackers negotiating for higher awards and back and forth messaging requesting more understanding.


### Expectation Setting

This one's important and probably the primary reason we encourage a clearly defined bounty structure. History has taught us that if expectations are misaligned someone is going to get frustrated. Case in point, a bounty ranging from $1000 - $3000 for a critical vulnerability sets the expectation that I may get $1000, $2000 or even $3000! In reality, the expectation is based on the severity of the vulnerability, which can be an objective international standard (see [CVSS Classification](https://docs.hackerone.com/programs/severity.html)) or unique calculation based on the risk appetite of a business and how they define impact severity. In both cases, a subjective review is required, and this is where the expectation mismatch happens.
Hackers already have three obstacles to overcome each with its expectation barrier before getting an award. These include:
    
1. Is the report valid? 
2. Is the report a critical severity vulnerability (or the same severity I class it)? 
3. Am I the first to find this bug?
4. Will I get $1000, $2000 or $3000? 

If one of these barriers is misaligned (they often are) it sparks frustration, debate, negotiation and in some cases public outbursts leading to mediation and increasing hacker disengagement and workload on your teams and HackerOne. 

By setting a level expectation, we also protect the "Bug Bounty Brand" and mitigate risk for you and your customers allowing you to reap the rewards of Bug Bounty efforts.
