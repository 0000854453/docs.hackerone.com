In a penetration test (pentest), authorized hackers simulate a cyberattack on a specific application to test how secure the application is. HackerOne pentests are performed by select hackers with skills and experience from the HackerOne community that best match your applications in scope.

> **Note:** To take part in HackerOne pentests, contact your account manager.  

### How it works

Hackers wanting to participate in pentests will need to apply to be pentesters through which HackerOne will review all applicants and decide which hackers meet the criteria to join the pentest community. Hackers that are a part of the pentest community will then be able to view available pentest opportunities from programs offering pentests. In order to participate in a pentest, hackers will need to apply to the specific pentest through which HackerOne will form a pentest team, which consists of 3 pentesters and 1 pentest lead.

Once the pentest team is formed, pentesters will have 33 hours to complete the pentest. After testing, the lead pentester will draft and submit a summary report of their findings.
