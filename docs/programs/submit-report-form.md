Hackers submit reports to your security team that contain detailed information about the security issues that the hacker has identified. 

One of the most important elements of running a successful bug bounty campaign is ensuring you get high quality reports where hackers are providing you with all the information you need to verify and validate the vulnerability. You can customize the form where hackers submit their vulnerability reports. 

### Customizing the Report Submissions Form Page
To customize your report submissions form page: 
1. Go to **Settings > Program > Submit Report Form**. 
2. Edit these sections:

Section | Details
------- | --------
Introduction Text | This text is shown at the top of the report submissions page for hackers. You can: <br><ul><li>highlight important information from your policy and bounty eligibility</li><li>specify attributes of a good report</li><li>address frequently asked questions</li><li>provide any additional guidance for hackers</li></ul>
Report Template | Configure the Markdown-based report template with the information you want hackers to provide. The template will be pre-populated with your requested fields when a hacker submits a new report. The more details you provide in the template, the more you ensure that hackers are providing you with all the information you need to verify and validate the report. <br> *Note: The template must be written in Markdown*. 
Weakness Configuration | All weaknesses are shown by default. To edit vulnerability display preferences, click **Edit** and you can choose from these options: <br><ul><li>Show: If you show a vulnerability type with special instructions, the instructions will be shown to hackers on the submission page upon selection.</li><li>Hide: If you hide a vulnerability type, the weakness disappears from the submission page and is no longer available to be selected by hackers.</li><li>Disable: If you disable a vulnerability type, it's still listed on the submission form but attempting to select it will trigger a warning message.</li></ul>
