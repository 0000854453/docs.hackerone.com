Hackers submit reports to your security team. Each report contains detailed information about the security issues that the hacker has identified. 

One of the most important elements of running a successful bug bounty campaign is ensuring you get high quality reports where hackers are providing you with all the information you need to verify and validate the vulnerability. You can customize the form where hackers submit their vulnerability reports. 

To customize your report submissions form page: 
1. Go to **Settings > Program > Submit Report Form**. 
2. Edit these sections:

Section | Details
------- | --------
Introduction Text | This text is shown at the top of the report submissions page for hackers. You can: <br><li>highlight important information from your policy and bounty eligibility</li><li>specify attributes of a good report</li><li>address frequently asked questions</li><li>provide any additional guidance for hackers</li>.

2. Customize the **Introduction Text** to engage the hacker. This text is shown at the top of the report submissions page for hackers. You can:
   * highlight important information from your policy and bounty eligibility
   * specify attributes of a good report
   * address frequently asked questions
   * provide any additional guidance for hackers 
3. Edit the **Report Template** to prompt hackers to provide you with the details that you need. This enables the template to be pre-loaded with your requested fields when a hacker submits a new report. This simplifies and provides greater guidelines for the hackers as they write their reports. *Note: The template must be written in Markdown*. 
4. Click the **Update introduction and template** button.
5. In the **Weakness Configuration** section, you can hide, disable, or show weaknesses by selecting the **Edit** button next to the weakness.
