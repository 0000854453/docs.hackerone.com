The Hacker Engagement dashboard shows metrics on hacker participation in your programs. Close attention to this data and follow-up actions will ensure that you have a healthy count of participating hackers for running a successful bug bounty and vulnerability disclosure program (VDP). These provide a deeper insight into how many hackers submit valid reports and how many return to your program over time. 

The data displayed is for the time period chosen with the date picker at the right-top. For example, if the yearly option is selected with dates from 09-Dec-2021 to 09-Dec-2022, then the data is shown for the entire year of 2022. Also, dates shown in the charts are for the beginning of the month, quarter or year. 

### Download Options
