You can customize your program's response SLA times by configuring the number of business days. To customize your program's response SLA time: 
1. Go to **Settings > Program > Response SLA**. 
2. Input the target response SLA time in days for your program under the **Target** column. 

Keep in mind that:
* To edit your program's response SLA settings, you need to have program permissions. 
* Modified targets will be applied to reports created after the modificationl
* Reports created before modification will have previous SLA targets applied.
