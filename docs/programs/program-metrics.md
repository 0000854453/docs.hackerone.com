Program metrics show how healthy a program is. They enable hackers to see various statistics regarding:
* Program information
* Response efficiency
* Bounty statistics

The metrics are displayed on the right side of the program's security page. 

To display program metrics on your security page:
1. Go to your program's **Settings > Programs > Customization > Metrics Display**. 
2. Select the statistics you want to display on your security page. 
3. Click **Update**.

### Response Efficiency Metrics
Response efficiency metrics include: 
* Average time to first response
* Average time to triage
* Average time to resolution
* Average time to bounty
The averages are calculated by the last 90 days. These metrics give hackers a better idea of how responsive a program is.

### Bounty Statistics

Bounty metrics are calculated over a programâ€™s lifetime and are designed to set realistic expectations with hackers and security teams. You can view:
* Total bounties paid
* Average bounty (Displayed as a range from the 45th to 55th percentile)
* Top bounty (Displayed as a range from the 90th to 100th percentile)

Total bounties paid can be a strong indicator that a bounty program is active and healthy. Similarly, the mean and median bounty serve as rough guidance for how much a hacker can expect in return for a valid report. For instance, if a hacker knowingly submits a critical bug to a program that where mean bounty is listed at $50, they will likely not expect $10,000 based on the program metrics.


Any reports filed by a security team's members will not be reflected in the metrics.
