COME BACK TO THIS ONE. INVITATIONS IS CURRENTLY TOTALLY BEING REVAMPED

In order for hackers to hack into private programs, hackers must receive invitations to the program. Private Programs can only invite hackers if they are under the Professional or Enterprise plans. 

### Expirations
Invitations to hack a program expire after 1 week. Sometimes hackers reject invitations to hack on programs for some reason. If we know sooner that the invite is not going to get used, we can send it to the next hacker earlier!
