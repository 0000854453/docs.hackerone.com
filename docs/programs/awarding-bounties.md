Bounties are awarded to attract the best hackers and to keep them incentivized to hack your programs. You can use bounties to encourage hackers to focus on particular assets by altering the reward amount for different vulernability types. Your security team determines when to offer a bounty as well as how much to reward. 
 

 
 In some cases, paying for a significant found vulnerability that is out of scope is also a good practice. However, you should not feel obligated to reward for every incoming report; only provide a bounty for useful, valid reports, and never feel the need to reward more for the same report. Just be sure to always communicate your reasoning clearly and firmly to researchers who spend time trying to help make you more secure. Keep your communications professional, as if they were public.
