You can export data from the HackerOne API and import it to the Kenna Security platform using the integration built between HackerOne and Kenna. You’ll need to set up a HackerOne connector in order to properly pull data.  

> **Note:** This integration was built by Kenna Security, and isn’t provided through HackerOne.

### Set up

To set up the HackerOne connector on the Kenna Security platform:
1. [Create an API token]( https://docs.hackerone.com/programs/api-tokens.html) on HackerOne.
2. Log in to your Kenna Security account
3. Click **Connectors**.  
4. Click **Add Connector**.

7. Click **Save And Verify**.

### How it works
Once you’ve set up the HackerOne connector and configured the integration, you can pull data from HackerOne while maintaining the integrity of data. You’ll need valid credentials in order to pull data using the connector. When you delete the connector, all data imported by the connector will also be deleted.
