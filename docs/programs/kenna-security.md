You can import HackerOne reports into the Kenna Security platform using the integration built between HackerOne and Kenna Security. This integration uses the HackerOne API, and you'll need to create a HackerOne API token to get started. 

> **Note:** This integration is built and maintained by Kenna Security. For questions please reach out to support@kennasecurity.com.

1. [Create an API token]( https://docs.hackerone.com/programs/api-tokens.html) on HackerOne.
2. Log in to your Kenna Security account
3. Click **Connectors**.

### How it works
Once you’ve set up the HackerOne connector and configured the integration, you can pull data from HackerOne while maintaining the integrity of data. You’ll need valid credentials in order to pull data using the connector. When you delete the connector, all data imported by the connector will also be deleted.
