Triggers are simple, but power tools for executing automated responses to new, incoming reports. You can use them to respond to a report where you frequently repeat yourself. It's best to not create overly broad triggers as false positives may annoy hackers. 

To set up triggers:
1. Go to **Settings > Program > Automation > Triggers**. 
2. Click **Add new Trigger**. 
3. Define the criteria for the trigger by entering keywords and selecting which part of the report must contain or not contain certain words. All criteria must match for the trigger to execute. 

by entering keywords and selecting what part of the report to search for those keywords.
