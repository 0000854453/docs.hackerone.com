Team member eligibility settings allows you to configure an allow list of email domains that are eligible to join 
your program. These settings will allow or block a user when accepting an invitation, but will not affect any users 
that are already a member of the program. This can be a helpful backstop to avoid invitations that are sent to the wrong
user and also to ensure those who are accepting the invitaiton will accept with the correct account.

To set this up, visit the Authentication page under your program settings.
