Public disclosure enables you to be transparent about the security vulnerabilities found for your program. HackerOne's public disclosure process balances transparency with control over what information is shared wtih the public.  

When publishing reports, the security team can choose to disclose the report in full or limit the information published. The default is to display all the communications between the hacker and the security team from first report to resolution. There are two ways a security teams can limit the information shared: 
* Redacting sensitive information 
* Limiting visibility to a summary written by your security team along with a partial timeline. 

Here's a good example of a summarized disclosure from the Shopify security team: https://hackerone.com/reports/64164.

### Requesting Public Disclosure
To request public disclosure:
1) Go to the report you want to publicly disclose. 
2) Make sure the report is closed. 
3) Select **Request public disclosure** in the action picker at the bottom of the report. 
4) Select whether you want to disclose the **Full** report or **Limited**. 
   
   Option | Details
   ------ | -------
   Full | Upon public disclosure, the full contents of the report are visible. 
   Limited | Only the summary and timeline of the activity will be visible. Limited disclosure allows for greater control over sensitive or extraneous information. 
   
5) *(Optional)* Enter a comment to describe your reasons for public disclosure. 
6) Click **Post**.
