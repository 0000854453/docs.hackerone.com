Public disclosure enables you to be transparent about the security vulnerabilities found for your program. HackerOne's public disclosure process balances transparency with control over what information is shared wtih the public.  

Programs can choose from 3 disclosure settings for programs:

Option | Detail
------ | -------
Disclosure by Default | The hacker or your security team can request public disclosure for any closed report in your program. If the admin of your program agrees to disclosure, the contents of the report will be made public within 30 days.<br> <br>*This is the default setting for all verified programs*. 
Disclosure requiring Mutual Agreement | The hacker can request public disclosure for any closed report in your program. If your program security team agrees to disclosure, the contents of the report will be made public. If the security team doesn't take any action, the contents of the report will remain private. <br>*You must request to opt-in to this option.* 
Disclosure Disabled | Public disclosure is not allowed for any report.

### Requesting Public Disclosure
Both hackers and program members can request public disclosure. To request public disclosure:
1) Go to the report you want to publicly disclose. 
2) Make sure the report is closed. 
3) Select **Request public disclosure** in the action picker at the bottom of the report. 
4) Select whether you want to disclose the **Full** report or **Limited**. 
   
   Option | Details
   ------ | -------
   Full | Upon public disclosure, the full contents of the report are visible including: <ul>Vulnerability information <ul>Summary <ul>Timeline such as comments and attachment<br>*Note: Internal comments are hidden.*  
   Limited | Only the summary and timeline of the activity will be visible. Limited disclosure allows for greater control over sensitive or extraneous information. 
   
5) *(Optional)* Enter a comment to describe your reasons for public disclosure. 
6) Click **Post**.

### Limiting Public Report Information

When publishing reports, the security team can choose to disclose the report in full or limit the information published. The default is to display all the communications between the hacker and the security team from first report to resolution. There are two ways a security teams can limit the information shared: 

Option | Detail
------ | -------
Redacting 


* Redacting sensitive information 
* Limiting visibility to a summary written by your security team along with a partial timeline. 

Here's a good example of a summarized disclosure from the Shopify security team: https://hackerone.com/reports/64164.
