With the Brinqa web URL integration, you can push all of your HackerOne submissions to Brinqa so that you can track all of your vulnerability reports on Brinqa.

The HackerOne connector requires an API ID and API Key to authenticate. Directions for creating these can be found here(/programs/api-tokens.html).

Once you have created your API ID and API Key, you can begin setting up the integration with Brinqa.

Within Brinqa, navigate to the data sources and create a new connector by selecting the HackerOne connector.

### How the Integration Works
After your Brinqa integration has been set up:
1. Change the action picker to **Change state > Triaged** in your report.

4. Click **Generate escalation**. Youâ€™ll be taken to your Brinqa account where the report is pre-populated.
5. Submit the issue to create the report in Brinqa.
6. Copy the Brinqa report issue number and paste it in the **Reference ID** field back in the HackerOne.
7. Click **Create** to create a direct reference link to the issue in Brinqa.
