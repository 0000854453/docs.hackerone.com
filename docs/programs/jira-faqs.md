The HackerOne markdown doesn't convert correctly to Jira. How can I convert the markdown correction to Jira? | You can use a Jira optimized template by setting the escalation template to: {{details_custom_jira}}.
What fields are supported in the bi-directional Jira integration? | We currently support these 4 fields:<br><ul><li>Summary</li><li> Description</li><li>Project</li><li>Issue_type</li></ul>All of the fields are required to correctly set up the Jira integration.<br><br>If you have an issue template that has more required fields than these 4, you need to update or create a new template to only require the 4 fields above.</br>
