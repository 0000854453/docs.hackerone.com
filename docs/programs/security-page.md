The Security Page contains key information about your program and your security disclosure policy. The Security Page sets expectations of hackers you invite to your bounty program and it also outlines your:
* Disclosure policy
* Bug eligibility
* Policy for in-scope eligibility

### Completing the Security Page
To edit your Security Page go to **Settings > General > Information**. 

A complete security page includes the following:
* Logo
* Cover Photo
* Overview
* Disclosure Policy
* Disclosure Rules
* Report Eligibility
* Reward Structure
* Policy

It's important to keep your security page up-to-date so hackers always know the important details about your program. Check out the security pages for Yahoo!, Twitter, and Dropbox for reference.

### Claiming the Security Page
Unless a security page is claimed, the page is curated by the HackerOne community. An organization can claim their security page in order to:
* Take editorial control of their disclosure policy
* Self-update their information
* Own their policy messaging

You don't have to be a HackerOne customer in order to claim a Security Page, though signing up for a free HackerOne account is necessary.

To claim a security page:
1. Find an unclaimed security page in the directory. 
*Note: Unclaimed pages have the **Claim this page** link on the right. ![unclaimed security page]

HackerOne reviews each claim submission for validity before granting the claim. A Security Page can only be claimed once. Once you claim your Security Page, the community can no longer edit it.
